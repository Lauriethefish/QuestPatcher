- [RedBrumbler](https://github.com/RedBrumbler), for creating the original [CLI tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher), which QP patching code is based on.
- [Bobbie](https://github.com/legoandmars) for the [logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/rewrite/QuestPatcher/Assets/questpatcher-logo.ico).
