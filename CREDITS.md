# Credits
- [Sc2ad](https://github.com/Sc2ad), for maintaining [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/), the modloader that Quatcher uses and for creating the QMOD schema. Helped quite a lot with getting the QMOD format to where it is.
- [RedBrumbler](https://github.com/RedBrumbler), for creating the original [CLI tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher), which QP patching code is based on.
- [Bobbie](https://github.com/legoandmars) for the [logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauriethefish/Quatcher/main/Quatcher/Assets/quatcher-logo.ico).
- [Marcus Zhou](https://github.com/SuperMarcus) for the code for patching with debugging support.
- [Raemien](https://github.com/Raemien) for the code for patching with hand tracking permissions.
