# QuestPatcher

QuestPatcher is a GUI based mod installer for any il2cpp unity app on the Oculus Quest that runs on Windows, Linux or macOS.
It was originally created for modding Gorilla Tag.

[Latest Stable Release](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/releases/latest) | [Latest Nightly Build](https://nightly.link/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/workflows/standalone/main)

It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and originally followed the patching process of RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

See `QuestPatcher.Core/Resources/qmod.schema.json` for the `mod.json` that QMODs must contain, alongside their mod files.
