# QuestPatcher

QuestPatcher is a GUI based mod installer for any il2cpp unity app on the Oculus Quest that runs on Windows or Linux.
It was originally created for modding Gorilla Tag.

It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and is based mostly on RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

See `QuestPatcher.Core/Resources/qmod.schema.json` for the `mod.json` that QMODs must contain, alongside their mod files.
